# Scripts

Welcome to the repository of all the important shell scripts I created/use on an everyday basis.

They're separated by category in directories. You can install scripts of a given category by running `make install` *(as root, if needed)* inside the chosen directory. The installed scripts will be located at `/usr/local/bin` by default. You can change this inside each `Makefile`.

If you want to install all the scripts, run `make install` here.

You can see what they do by reading the source code, although I do want to write some kind of documentation in the future.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the scripts under the terms of the [MIT license.](LICENSE)
